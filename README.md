## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

This is an example on how to make use of swagger customJs option.

## Explanation

As of now, the swagger customJs option requires a path to a custom js file.

This is provided via the endpoint `http://localhost:3000/customJs`.

On Swagger UI loading, the path is called and the js file retrieved.

The js file waits for the window loading, listens to the `auth-wrapper` and executes a function once it is clicked and the popup opens.

## See working example

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start:dev
```
Open the [application](http://localhost:3000/swagger)

Clicking on the Authorize button will open a popup with the authorization code and already prefilled input fields.
